Metadata Schema Upgrade

The topology you are connected to is using an outdated metadata schema version 1.0.1 and needs to be upgraded to 2.1.0.

Without doing this upgrade, no AdminAPI calls except read only operations will be allowed.

NOTE: After the upgrade, this InnoDB Cluster/ReplicaSet can no longer be managed using older versions of MySQL Shell.

The grants for the MySQL Router accounts that were created automatically when bootstrapping need to be updated to match the new metadata version's requirements.
NOTE: No automatically created Router accounts were found.
WARNING: If MySQL Routers have been bootstrapped using custom accounts, their grants can not be updated during the metadata upgrade, they have to be updated using the setupRouterAccount function.
For additional information use: \? setupRouterAccount

Upgrading metadata at '<<<hostname>>>:<<<__mysql_sandbox_port1>>>' from version 1.0.1 to version 2.1.0.
Upgrade will require 2 steps
Creating backup of the metadata schema...
Step 1 of 2: upgrading from 1.0.1 to 2.0.0...
Step 2 of 2: upgrading from 2.0.0 to 2.1.0...
Removing metadata backup...
Upgrade process successfully finished, metadata schema is now on version 2.1.0
