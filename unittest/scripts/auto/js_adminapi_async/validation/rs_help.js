RETURNS
      Nothing.

DESCRIPTION
      This function adds the given MySQL instance as a read-only SECONDARY
      replica of the current PRIMARY of the replicaset. Replication will be
      configured between the added instance and the PRIMARY. Replication will
      use an automatically created MySQL account with a random password.

      Once the instance is added to the replicaset, the function will wait for
      it to apply all pending transactions. The transaction sync may timeout if
      the transaction backlog is large. The timeout option may be used to
      increase that time.

      The Shell connects to the target instance using the same username and
      password used to obtain the replicaset handle object. All instances of
      the replicaset are expected to have this same admin account with the same
      grants and passwords. A custom admin account with the required grants can
      be created while an instance is configured with
      dba.configureReplicaSetInstance(), but the root user may be used too.

      The PRIMARY of the replicaset must be reachable and available during this
      operation.

      Pre-Requisites

      The following pre-requisites are expected for instances added to a
      replicaset. They will be automatically checked by addInstance(), which
      will stop if any issues are found.

      - binary log and replication related options must have been validated
        and/or configured by dba.configureReplicaSetInstance()

      If the selected recovery method is incremental:

      - transaction set in the instance being added must not contain
        transactions that don't exist in the PRIMARY
      - transaction set in the instance being added must not be missing
        transactions that have been purged from the binary log of the PRIMARY

      If clone is available, the pre-requisites listed above can be overcome by
      using clone as the recovery method.

      Options

      The options dictionary may contain the following values:

      - dryRun: if true, performs checks and logs changes that would be made,
        but does not execute them
      - label: an identifier for the instance being added, used in the output
        of status()
      - recoveryMethod: Preferred method of state recovery. May be auto, clone
        or incremental. Default is auto.
      - waitRecovery: Integer value to indicate the recovery process verbosity
        level.
      - cloneDonor: host:port of an existing replicaSet member to clone from.
        IPv6 addresses are not supported for this option.
      - interactive: boolean value used to disable/enable the wizards in the
        command execution, i.e. prompts and confirmations will be provided or
        not according to the value set. The default value is equal to MySQL
        Shell wizard mode.
      - timeout: timeout in seconds for transaction sync operations; 0 disables
        timeout and force the Shell to wait until the transaction sync
        finishes. Defaults to 0.

      The recoveryMethod option supports the following values:

      - incremental: waits until the new instance has applied missing
        transactions from the PRIMARY
      - clone: uses MySQL clone to provision the instance, which completely
        replaces the state of the target instance with a full snapshot of
        another ReplicaSet member. Requires MySQL 8.0.17 or newer.
      - auto: compares the transaction set of the instance with that of the
        PRIMARY to determine if incremental recovery is safe to be
        automatically chosen as the most appropriate recovery method. A prompt
        will be shown if not possible to safely determine a safe way forward.
        If interaction is disabled, the operation will be canceled instead.

      If recoveryMethod is not specified 'auto' will be used by default.

      The waitRecovery option supports the following values:

      - 0: not supported.
      - 1: do not show any progress information.
      - 2: show detailed static progress information.
      - 3: show detailed dynamic progress information using progress bars.

      By default, if the standard output on which the Shell is running refers
      to a terminal, the waitRecovery option has the value of 3. Otherwise, it
      has the value of 2.

      The cloneDonor option is used to override the automatic selection of a
      donor to be used when clone is selected as the recovery method. By
      default, a SECONDARY member will be chosen as donor. If no SECONDARY
      members are available the PRIMARY will be selected. The option accepts
      values in the format: 'host:port'. IPv6 addresses are not supported.

//@<OUT> Disconnect
NAME
      disconnect - Disconnects all internal sessions used by the replicaset
                   object.

SYNTAX
      <ReplicaSet>.disconnect()

RETURNS
      Nothing.

DESCRIPTION
      Disconnects the internal MySQL sessions used by the replicaset to query
      for metadata and replication information.

//@<OUT> Force Primary Instance
NAME
      forcePrimaryInstance - Performs a failover in a replicaset with an
                             unavailable PRIMARY.

SYNTAX
      <ReplicaSet>.forcePrimaryInstance(instance, options)

WHERE
      instance: host:port of the target instance to be promoted. If blank, a
                suitable instance will be selected automatically.
      options: Dictionary with additional options.

RETURNS
      Nothing

DESCRIPTION
      This command will perform a forced failover of the PRIMARY of a
      replicaset in disaster scenarios where the current PRIMARY is unavailable
      and cannot be restored. If given, the target instance will be promoted to
      a PRIMARY, while other reachable SECONDARY instances will be switched to
      the new PRIMARY. The target instance must have the most up-to-date
      GTID_EXECUTED set among reachable instances, otherwise the operation will
      fail. If a target instance is not given (or is null), the most up-to-date
      instance will be automatically selected and promoted.

      After a forced failover, the old PRIMARY will be considered invalid by
      the new PRIMARY and can no longer be part of the replicaset. If the
      instance is still usable, it must be removed from the replicaset and
      re-added as a new instance. If there were any SECONDARY instances that
      could not be switched to the new PRIMARY during the failover, they will
      also be considered invalid.

      ATTENTION: a forced failover is a potentially destructive action and
                 should only be used as a last resort measure.

      Data loss is possible after a failover, because the old PRIMARY may have
      had transactions that were not yet replicated to the SECONDARY being
      promoted. Moreover, if the instance that was presumed to have failed is
      still able to process updates, for example because the network where it
      is located is still functioning but unreachable from the shell, it will
      continue diverging from the promoted clusters. Recovering or
      re-conciliating diverged transaction sets requires manual intervention
      and may some times not be possible, even if the failed MySQL servers can
      be recovered. In many cases, the fastest and simplest way to recover from
      a disaster that required a forced failover is by discarding such diverged
      transactions and re-provisioning a new instance from the newly promoted
      PRIMARY.

      Options

      The following options may be given:

      - dryRun: if true, will perform checks and log operations that would be
        performed, but will not execute them. The operations that would be
        performed can be viewed by enabling verbose output in the shell.
      - timeout: integer value with the maximum number of seconds to wait until
        the instance being promoted catches up to the current PRIMARY.
      - invalidateErrorInstances: if false, aborts the failover if any instance
        other than the old master is unreachable or has errors. If true, such
        instances will not be failed over and be invalidated.

WHERE
      instance: host:port of the target instance to be rejoined.
      options: Dictionary with options for the operation.

RETURNS
      Nothing.

DESCRIPTION
      This function rejoins the given MySQL instance to the replicaset, making
      it a read-only SECONDARY replica of the current PRIMARY. Only instances
      previously added to the replicaset can be rejoined, otherwise the
      <ReplicaSet>.addInstance() function must be used to add a new instance.

      The PRIMARY of the replicaset must be reachable and available during this
      operation.

      Pre-Requisites

      The following pre-requisites are expected for instances rejoined to a
      replicaset. They will be automatically checked by rejoinInstance(), which
      will stop if any issues are found.

      If the selected recovery method is incremental:

      - transaction set in the instance being rejoined must not contain
        transactions that don't exist in the PRIMARY
      - transaction set in the instance being rejoined must not be missing
        transactions that have been purged from the binary log of the PRIMARY
      - executed transactions set (GTID_EXECUTED) in the instance being
        rejoined must not be empty.

      If clone is available, the pre-requisites listed above can be overcome by
      using clone as the recovery method.

      Options

      The options dictionary may contain the following values:

      - dryRun: if true, performs checks and logs changes that would be made,
        but does not execute them
      - recoveryMethod: Preferred method of state recovery. May be auto, clone
        or incremental. Default is auto.
      - waitRecovery: Integer value to indicate the recovery process verbosity
        level.
      - cloneDonor: host:port of an existing replicaSet member to clone from.
        IPv6 addresses are not supported for this option.
      - interactive: boolean value used to disable/enable the wizards in the
        command execution, i.e. prompts and confirmations will be provided or
        not according to the value set. The default value is equal to MySQL
        Shell wizard mode.
      - timeout: timeout in seconds for transaction sync operations; 0 disables
        timeout and force the Shell to wait until the transaction sync
        finishes. Defaults to 0.

      The recoveryMethod option supports the following values:

      - incremental: waits until the rejoining instance has applied missing
        transactions from the PRIMARY
      - clone: uses MySQL clone to provision the instance, which completely
        replaces the state of the target instance with a full snapshot of
        another ReplicaSet member. Requires MySQL 8.0.17 or newer.
      - auto: compares the transaction set of the instance with that of the
        PRIMARY to determine if incremental recovery is safe to be
        automatically chosen as the most appropriate recovery method. A prompt
        will be shown if not possible to safely determine a safe way forward.
        If interaction is disabled, the operation will be canceled instead.

      If recoveryMethod is not specified 'auto' will be used by default.

      The waitRecovery option supports the following values:

      - 0: not supported.
      - 1: do not show any progress information.
      - 2: show detailed static progress information.
      - 3: show detailed dynamic progress information using progress bars.

      By default, if the standard output on which the Shell is running refers
      to a terminal, the waitRecovery option has the value of 3. Otherwise, it
      has the value of 2.

      The cloneDonor option is used to override the automatic selection of a
      donor to be used when clone is selected as the recovery method. By
      default, a SECONDARY member will be chosen as donor. If no SECONDARY
      members are available the PRIMARY will be selected. The option accepts
      values in the format: 'host:port'. IPv6 addresses are not supported.

//@<OUT> Remove Instance
NAME
      removeInstance - Removes an Instance from the replicaset.

SYNTAX
      <ReplicaSet>.removeInstance(instance[, options])

WHERE
      instance: host:port of the target instance to be removed
      options: Dictionary with options for the operation.

RETURNS
      Nothing.

DESCRIPTION
      This function removes an Instance from the replicaset and stops it from
      replicating. The instance must not be the PRIMARY and it is expected to
      be reachable.

      The PRIMARY of the replicaset must be reachable and available during this
      operation.

      Options

      The instance definition is the connection data for the instance.

      The options dictionary may contain the following attributes:

      - force: boolean, indicating if the instance must be removed (even if
        only from metadata) in case it cannot be reached. By default, set to
        false.
      - timeout: maximum number of seconds to wait for the instance to sync up
        with the PRIMARY. 0 means no timeout and <0 will skip sync.

      The force option (set to true) is required to remove instances that are
      unreachable. Removed instances are normally synchronized with the rest of
      the replicaset, so that their own copy of the metadata will be consistent
      and the instance will be suitable for being added back to the replicaset.
      When the force option is set during removal, that step will be skipped.

//@<OUT> Set Primary Instance
NAME
      setPrimaryInstance - Performs a safe PRIMARY switchover, promoting the
                           given instance.

SYNTAX
      <ReplicaSet>.setPrimaryInstance(instance, options)

WHERE
      instance: host:port of the target instance to be promoted.
      options: Dictionary with additional options.

RETURNS
      Nothing

DESCRIPTION
      This command will perform a safe switchover of the PRIMARY of a
      replicaset. The current PRIMARY will be demoted to a SECONDARY and made
      read-only, while the promoted instance will be made a read-write master.
      All other SECONDARY instances will be updated to replicate from the new
      PRIMARY.

      During the switchover, the promoted instance will be synchronized with
      the old PRIMARY, ensuring that all transactions present in the PRIMARY
      are applied before the topology change is commited. If that
      synchronization step takes too long or is not possible in any of the
      SECONDARY instances, the switch will be aborted. These problematic
      SECONDARY instances must be either repaired or removed from the
      replicaset for the fail over to be possible.

      For a safe switchover to be possible, all replicaset instances must be
      reachable from the shell and have consistent transaction sets. If the
      PRIMARY is not available, a forced failover must be performed instead,
      using forcePrimaryInstance().

      Options

      The following options may be given:

      - dryRun: if true, will perform checks and log operations that would be
        performed, but will not execute them. The operations that would be
        performed can be viewed by enabling verbose output in the shell.
      - timeout: integer value with the maximum number of seconds to wait until
        the instance being promoted catches up to the current PRIMARY.

      options: Dictionary with options for the operation.

RETURNS
      Nothing.

DESCRIPTION
      This function creates/upgrades a MySQL user account with the necessary
      privileges to administer an InnoDB ReplicaSet.

      This function also allows a user to upgrade an existing admin account
      with the necessary privileges before a dba.upgradeMetadata() call.

      The mandatory argument user is the name of the MySQL account we want to
      create or upgrade to be used as Administrator account. The accepted

      provided defaults to '%'.

      The options dictionary may contain the following attributes:

      - password: The password for the InnoDB ReplicaSet administrator account.
      - dryRun: boolean value used to enable a dry run of the account setup
        process. Default value is False.
      - interactive: boolean value used to disable/enable the wizards in the
        command execution, i.e. prompts and confirmations will be provided or
        not according to the value set. The default value is equal to MySQL
        Shell wizard mode.
      - update: boolean value that must be enabled to allow updating the
        privileges and/or password of existing accounts. Default value is
        False.

      If the user account does not exist, the password is mandatory.

      If the user account exists, the update option must be enabled.

      If dryRun is used, the function will display information about the
      permissions to be granted to `user` account without actually creating
      and/or performing any changes on it.

      The interactive option can be used to explicitly enable or disable the
      interactive prompts that help the user through the account setup process.

      The update option must be enabled to allow updating an existing account's
      privileges and/or password.

      - _disconnect_existing_sessions_when_hidden: bool - instructs the router
        to disconnect existing connections from instances that are marked to be
        hidden.

      NOTE: '_hidden' and '_disconnect_existing_sessions_when_hidden' can be
            useful to shut down the instance and perform maintenance on it
            without disrupting incoming application traffic.

      listRouters - Lists the Router instances.

SYNTAX
      <ReplicaSet>.listRouters([options])

WHERE
      options: Dictionary with options for the operation.

      A JSON object listing the Router instances associated to the ReplicaSet.

DESCRIPTION
      This function lists and provides information about all Router instances
      registered for the ReplicaSet.

      Whenever a Metadata Schema upgrade is necessary, the recommended process
      is to upgrade MySQL Router instances to the latest version before
      upgrading the Metadata itself, in order to minimize service disruption.

      The options dictionary may contain the following attributes:

      - onlyUpgradeRequired: boolean, enables filtering so only router
        instances that support older version of the Metadata Schema and require
        upgrade are included.
