// Display the help for MySQL Shell (mysqlsh --help) and verify that the option --pager is present

//@ help should contain information about --pager option
|  --pager=<value>                  Pager used to display text output of|
|                                   statements executed in SQL mode as well as|
|                                   some other selected commands. Pager can be|
|                                   manually enabled in scripting modes. If you|
|                                   don't supply an option, the default pager is|
|                                   taken from your ENV variable PAGER. This|
|                                   option only works in interactive mode. This|
|                                   option is disabled by default.|
