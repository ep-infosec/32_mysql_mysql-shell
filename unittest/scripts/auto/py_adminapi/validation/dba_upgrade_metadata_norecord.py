#@<OUT> Creates the sample cluster
A new InnoDB Cluster will be created on instance '<<<hostname>>>:<<<__mysql_sandbox_port1>>>'.

Validating instance configuration at localhost:<<<__mysql_sandbox_port1>>>...
NOTE: Instance detected as a sandbox.
Please note that sandbox instances are only suitable for deploying test clusters for use within the same host.

This instance reports its own address as <<<hostname>>>:<<<__mysql_sandbox_port1>>>

Instance configuration is suitable.
NOTE: Group Replication will communicate with other members using '<<<hostname>>>:<<<__mysql_sandbox_gr_port1>>>'. Use the localAddress option to override.

?{VER(<8.0.0)}
WARNING: Instance '<<<hostname>>>:<<<__mysql_sandbox_port1>>>' cannot persist Group Replication configuration since MySQL version <<<__version>>> does not support the SET PERSIST command (MySQL version >= 8.0.11 required). Please use the dba.configure_local_instance() command locally to persist the changes.

Creating InnoDB Cluster 'sample' on '<<<hostname>>>:<<<__mysql_sandbox_port1>>>'...

Adding Seed Instance...
Cluster successfully created. Use Cluster.add_instance() to add MySQL instances.
At least 3 instances are needed for the cluster to be able to withstand up to
one server failure.

#@<OUT> Upgrades the metadata, no registered routers
Metadata Schema Upgrade

The topology you are connected to is using an outdated metadata schema version 1.0.1 and needs to be upgraded to 2.1.0.

Without doing this upgrade, no AdminAPI calls except read only operations will be allowed.

NOTE: After the upgrade, this InnoDB Cluster/ReplicaSet can no longer be managed using older versions of MySQL Shell.

The grants for the MySQL Router accounts that were created automatically when bootstrapping need to be updated to match the new metadata version's requirements.
NOTE: No automatically created Router accounts were found.
WARNING: If MySQL Routers have been bootstrapped using custom accounts, their grants can not be updated during the metadata upgrade, they have to be updated using the setup_router_account function.
For additional information use: \? setup_router_account

There are 10 Routers to upgrade. Please upgrade them and select Continue once they are restarted.

NOTE: If Router's Metadata Cache TTL is high Router's own update in the Metadata will take longer. Re-check for outdated Routers if that's the case or alternatively restart the Router.

  1) Re-check for outdated Routers and continue with the metadata upgrade.
  2) Unregister the remaining Routers.
  3) Abort the operation.
